## Missing Graph Printer Plugin

Some downloadable project files may state that the _Graph Plugin_ is missing. This plugin was used during the writing of the book to get snapshots of the Blueprint code. You can simply ignore it as it is no necessary for the project in itself.
However, if you'd like to use it, it's freely available on the [Epic Games Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/graph-printer).
