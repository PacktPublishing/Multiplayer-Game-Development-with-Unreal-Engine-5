# Using the project with Unreal Engine 5.2 and higher

Here you can find some advice on how to make the project files fully functional with Unreal Engine 5.2 and higher.

## Chapter 7

Starting from **Unreal Engine 5.2** the `BlueprintPure` function specifier (used in _Chapter 7, Using Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)_) is no longer supported in interface classes. This means your code won't compile in **Unreal Engine 5.2** once you add the `US_Interactable.h` interface.

To make your code fully operational and buildable, you will need to change, inside the `US_Interactable.h` file the following line of code:

```
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, BlueprintNativeEvent, BlueprintPure, Category = "Interaction", meta=(DisplayName="Can Interact"))
bool CanInteract(AUS_Character* CharacterInstigator) const;
```

to

```
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, BlueprintNativeEvent, Category = "Interaction", meta=(DisplayName="Can Interact"))
bool CanInteract(AUS_Character* CharacterInstigator) const;
```
